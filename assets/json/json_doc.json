It presents a step-by-step approach by which pastors should conduct such ceremonies. The Manual takes into consideration the theological position and biblical principles as practiced in the ministry of the Church. This Manual serves as a practical guide and resource for the minister. It provides the standard for excellence and order in pastoral duties. The scripture enjoins us in 1 Corinthians 14: 40 that we should “Let all things be done decently and in order.” It is our prayer that this Manual will enrich the ministry of the pastor and the Church and be a blessing to all people. *b*b1.

The ceremony also gives the child an identity by conferring upon him/her names chosen by the parents or guardian. Names play a very important role in the life of an individual. A name sets apart a person from others and their purpose in life. For example, the announcement of the name “Jesus” in Matthew 1:21 helps us to understand the mission of Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world. Parents must therefore be advised to prayerfully choose names that shall be a blessing to their child. *b2.*b *bGeneral Guidelines*b The child naming ceremony is a momentous occasion, which presents an opportunity to celebrate the goodness and faithfulness of God. The Officiating Minister shall be guided by the following: \na. The Officiating Minister\n 1 should prepare adequately to officiate with a team including an assistant (e.g. a church leader), a chorus leader, ushers, etc. \nb.\t The program should be discussed with the parents before the\n celebration so that there would be an understanding by all parties of what to expect. \nc.\t The name of the child should be printed on paper in bold fonts and\n presented to the Officiating Minister upon his/her arrival. \nd.

At this ceremony the church also receives the child into the fellowship of Christ and pledges to nourish him/her through teaching and the setting of good examples as role models.  The baby Jesus was presented to God at the temple in Jerusalem by His earthly parents [Mathew 2:22]. This act of dedication provides a biblical basis for the dedication of children. By this ceremony parents acknowledge that the child is a gift from God and therefore dedicate themselves to be a godly example to him/her. Dedication does not impart salvation to a child. Salvation comes only through faith in Jesus Christ when the child reaches the age of accountability and accepts Jesus Christ as his/her Lord and Saviour.  The dedication ceremony is a symbolic act of entrusting the child’s life to God’s will. *b2.*b *bGeneral Guidelines*b \na.\t Arrangements for the dedication of the child should be made by\n the Officiating Minister prior to the dedication. \nb.

Names play a very important role in the life of an individual. It has spiritual and social influences on a person.

The announcement of the name and purpose of Jesus Christ in *bMatthew 1:21*b helps us to understand the mission of Jesus Christ.

Psalm 127:3 states that children are a heritage from the LORD; and the fruit of the womb is a reward. As believers, we recognise this fact and thankfully give back the children to the Lord for His care and protection. In Luke 2:22 Mary and Joseph brought the baby Jesus to the temple in Jerusalem in order to present him before the Lord. In the same way, [name of parents] today present themselves and their child, [name of child] to the Lord. *b*b4.     Pledges*b*b \n*ba.

                "content": "*b4.1     GENERAL GUIDELINES*b *b*b1.        Introduction*b*b Rites of passage are conducted in the church to transition children who have been groomed, to the youth church, and the youth to the adult church. This is done to ensure consistent growth and development of children and youth in the church, to be spiritually sensitive to God and morally upright as they grow from stage to stage. It also gives the church the opportunity to acknowledge the development of young persons in their journey of life. There are two rites of passage practiced in the church. The first rite of passage is *bthe Purity Service,*b which transitions the children from the children’s church into the youth church. The second, *bthe Sanctification*b *bService,*b is the transition service from the youth church into the adult church. The first rite of passage is the Purity Service, which transitions the children from the children’s church into the youth church. The second, the Sanctification Service, is the transition service from the youth church into the adult church. Candidates of the purity service are usually twelve (12) years or at the last stage of their primary education. Candidates of the sanctification service are usually fifteen (15) years or at the last stage of their Junior High education. The rites of passage mark the turning point in the life of the children and youth. They are intended to bring an awareness of the knowledge and presence of God in their lives, understand who they are in Christ and birth a desire to witness their faith publicly. They must be growing into responsible believers, fully partaking in the church’s spiritual disciplines. *bNB:*b \n*tThe Rites of Passage may be an integral part of Sunday Worship Service or*t\n \n*theld as a separate service.*t\n *b*b4.

It is enshrined in our commission to go and make disciples of all nations *b(Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:16).*b  Baptism symbolizes the death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord. It also identifies the believer with our LORD Jesus Christ. The ordinance is a public confession of our faith in Christ. *b*b2.     General Guidelines*b*b Only persons who have received Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour qualify to be baptized *b(Acts 2:41, Acts 8:12, Acts 8:13, Acts 18:8, Acts*b *b8:36-37, Acts 16:30-33).*b Infants should not be baptised because there is no scriptural basis for such an act. When the infant Jesus was taken into the temple, He was not baptized. Rather, He was dedicated to God (Luke 2:23-24). Christ was baptised when He came of age (Luke 3:21-22; Matt. 3:13-17). The word baptism is from the Greek word, “baptizo”, which implies to immerse fully in water. Therefore, the baptism of the believer is only by immersion in water. *b*b3.      Preparation*b*b \na.\t The Ordinance should be conducted in a spirit of reverence and\n dignity. \nb.\t The Officiating Minister should work with a team of at least two\n leaders who would assist him (her) to conduct the baptism. \nc.\t Prior to the baptism, there should be a Preparatory Class where\n baptismal candidates should be thoroughly instructed on the purpose and significance of baptism. \nd.\t The Officiating Minister shall teach and demonstrate each step of\n *b*b1.

It is enshrined in our commission to go and make disciples of all nations *b(Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:16).*b  Baptism symbolizes the death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord. It also identifies the believer with our LORD Jesus Christ. The ordinance is a public confession of our faith in Christ. *b*b2.     General Guidelines*b*b Only persons who have received Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour qualify to be baptized *b(Acts 2:41, Acts 8:12, Acts 8:13, Acts 18:8, Acts*b *b8:36-37, Acts 16:30-33).*b Infants should not be baptised because there is no scriptural basis for such an act. When the infant Jesus was taken into the temple, He was not baptized. Rather, He was dedicated to God (Luke 2:23-24). Christ was baptised when He came of age (Luke 3:21-22; Matt. 3:13-17). The word baptism is from the Greek word, “baptizo”, which implies to immerse fully in water. Therefore, the baptism of the believer is only by immersion in water. *b*b3.      Preparation*b*b \na.\t The Ordinance should be conducted in a spirit of reverence and\n dignity. \nb.\t The Officiating Minister should work with a team of at least two\n leaders who would assist him (her) to conduct the baptism. \nc.\t Prior to the baptism, there should be a Preparatory Class where\n baptismal candidates should be thoroughly instructed on the purpose and significance of baptism. \nd.\t The Officiating Minister shall teach and demonstrate each step of\n *b*b1.

For example, the temple built by King Solomon with all its vessels (1 Ki. 8:23-66) and the wall of Jerusalem re-built by Nehemiah (Neh. 12:27-43) were dedicated to God. There were persons who were also dedicated to God such as Samuel (1 Sam. 1:20-28), Sampson and Jesus Christ (Luke 2:22-24). Dedications are done in recognition of the fact that God Almighty is the giver of life and all good things (Rom. 11:36a, 1 Cor. 4:7, Jas. 1:17). Dedication ceremonies are acts of worship to the Lord, and should be officiated with due diligence so as to honour the name of God. *b*b2.     General Guidelines*b*b \ni.\t The ceremony should be carefully planned and each person\n involved should know what is expected of him (her). ii.\t Volunteers required: Ushers, Music Team, Sound Technician, Multi-media Team. iii.\tInvited guests may include community officials, the architect (if it is a building), the media, etc. iv.\t Where appropriate, special seats should be reserved for dignitaries. *b*b3.     Groundbreaking Ceremony*b*b \ni.\t These guidelines apply to the construction of a church building,\n home or any other facility. The Officiating Minister will adapt the service outline to suit the particular context. ii.\t A groundbreaking is usually a brief ceremony held on a convenient date for all persons expected to be present. In the case of the construction of a church building, it is recommended that the ceremony should be held on a Sunday after the worship *b*b3.   DEDICATION OF PROPERTY*b*b "

It is enshrined in our commission to go and make disciples of all nations *b(Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:16).*b  Baptism symbolizes the death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord. It also identifies the believer with our LORD Jesus Christ. The ordinance is a public confession of our faith in Christ. *b*b2.     General Guidelines*b*b Only persons who have received Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour qualify to be baptized *b(Acts 2:41, Acts 8:12, Acts 8:13, Acts 18:8, Acts*b *b8:36-37, Acts 16:30-33).*b Infants should not be baptised because there is no scriptural basis for such an act. When the infant Jesus was taken into the temple, He was not baptized. Rather, He was dedicated to God (Luke 2:23-24). Christ was baptised when He came of age (Luke 3:21-22; Matt. 3:13-17). The word baptism is from the Greek word, “baptizo”, which implies to immerse fully in water. Therefore, the baptism of the believer is only by immersion in water. *b*b3.      Preparation*b*b \na.\t The Ordinance should be conducted in a spirit of reverence and\n dignity. \nb.\t The Officiating Minister should work with a team of at least two\n leaders who would assist him (her) to conduct the baptism. \nc.\t Prior to the baptism, there should be a Preparatory Class where\n baptismal candidates should be thoroughly instructed on the purpose and significance of baptism. \nd.\t The Officiating Minister shall teach and demonstrate each step of\n *b*b1.

For example, the temple built by King Solomon with all its vessels (1 Ki. 8:23-66) and the wall of Jerusalem re-built by Nehemiah (Neh. 12:27-43) were dedicated to God. There were persons who were also dedicated to God such as Samuel (1 Sam. 1:20-28), Sampson and Jesus Christ (Luke 2:22-24). Dedications are done in recognition of the fact that God Almighty is the giver of life and all good things (Rom. 11:36a, 1 Cor. 4:7, Jas. 1:17). Dedication ceremonies are acts of worship to the Lord, and should be officiated with due diligence so as to honour the name of God. *b*b2.     General Guidelines*b*b \ni.\t The ceremony should be carefully planned and each person\n involved should know what is expected of him (her). ii.\t Volunteers required: Ushers, Music Team, Sound Technician, Multi-media Team. iii.\tInvited guests may include community officials, the architect (if it is a building), the media, etc. iv.\t Where appropriate, special seats should be reserved for dignitaries. *b*b3.

I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness. 11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD will give grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly. 12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in You!

It is enshrined in our commission to go and make disciples of all nations *b(Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:16).*b  Baptism symbolizes the death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord. It also identifies the believer with our LORD Jesus Christ. The ordinance is a public confession of our faith in Christ. *b*b2.     General Guidelines*b*b Only persons who have received Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour qualify to be baptized *b(Acts 2:41, Acts 8:12, Acts 8:13, Acts 18:8, Acts*b *b8:36-37, Acts 16:30-33).*b Infants should not be baptised because there is no scriptural basis for such an act. When the infant Jesus was taken into the temple, He was not baptized. Rather, He was dedicated to God (Luke 2:23-24). Christ was baptised when He came of age (Luke 3:21-22; Matt. 3:13-17). The word baptism is from the Greek word, “baptizo”, which implies to immerse fully in water. Therefore, the baptism of the believer is only by immersion in water. *b*b3.      Preparation*b*b \na.\t The Ordinance should be conducted in a spirit of reverence and\n dignity. \nb.\t The Officiating Minister should work with a team of at least two\n leaders who would assist him (her) to conduct the baptism. \nc.\t Prior to the baptism, there should be a Preparatory Class where\n baptismal candidates should be thoroughly instructed on the purpose and significance of baptism. \nd.\t The Officiating Minister shall teach and demonstrate each step of\n *b*b1.

There were persons who were also dedicated to God such as Samuel (1 Sam. 1:20-28), Sampson and Jesus Christ (Luke 2:22-24). Dedications are done in recognition of the fact that God Almighty is the giver of life and all good things (Rom. 11:36a, 1 Cor. 4:7, Jas. 1:17).
